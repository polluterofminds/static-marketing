          <strong>Binding Arbitration</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal
          negotiations, the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded
          below) will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding
          arbitration. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD
          HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration
          shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration
          Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") and, where
          appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related
          Disputes ("AAA Consumer Rules"), both of which are available at the
          AAA website www.adr.org. Your arbitration fees and your share of
          arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules
          and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. The
          arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of
          documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in
          writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested
          by either Party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any
          award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except where
          otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or applicable law, the
          arbitration will take place in United States County, Texas. Except as
          otherwise provided herein, the Parties may litigate in court to compel
          arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm,
          modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the
          arbitrator.
        </p>
        <p>
          If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than
          arbitration, the Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted in the state
          and federal courts located in united states County, Texas, and the
          Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal
          jurisdiction, and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and
          jurisdiction in such state and federal courts. Application of the
          United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of
          Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) are
          excluded from these Terms of Use.
        </p>
        <p>
          In no event shall any Dispute brought by either Party related in any
          way to the Site be commenced more than one (1) years after the cause
          of action arose. If this provision is found to be illegal or
          unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute
          falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or
          unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of
          competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction
          above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of
          that court.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Restrictions</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute
          between the Parties individually. To the full extent permitted by law,
          (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b)
          there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a
          class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c)
          there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a
          purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or
          any other persons.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the
          above provisions concerning informal negotiations and binding
          arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or
          concerning the validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of
          a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of
          theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any
          claim for injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be illegal
          or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any
          Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be
          illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court
          of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction
          above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of
          that court.
